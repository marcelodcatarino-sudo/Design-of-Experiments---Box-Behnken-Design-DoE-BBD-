# Design of Experiments - Box-Behnken Design (DoE-BBD)
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on applying a DoE-BBD approach to test different conditions on the extraction of bioactive compounds from algae. The objective is to explore which factors most influence extraction performance and to identify promising parameter combinations for future optimization.
